In this project, we are building a high-performance 300W Modified Sine Wave Inverter. This device is designed to convert 12V DC (from a battery) into 220V AC, allowing you to power household appliances like LED bulbs, fans, and chargers during power outages or for off-grid applications. Using the SG3525 PWM IC, this prototype offers a stable frequency and high efficiency compared to simpler transistor-based designs.

Tools & Hardware:
 * Custom PCB (Gerber files provided in video description)
 * Heatsinks (Aluminum, for MOSFETs)
 * 12V DC Power Source (Li-ion battery pack or Lead-acid battery)
 * Soldering Iron and Solder Wire
 * Multimeter (For testing)

Step 1: Circuit Design and PCB Preparation
The heart of this inverter is the SG3525 Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) IC. Unlike simple oscillators, this IC provides a precise frequency (50Hz/60Hz) and dual-channel output to drive the MOSFETs in a "push-pull" configuration.
For a professional build, it is recommended to use a custom PCB. You can export the Gerber files and order them from a service like JLCPCB. This ensures the high-current traces are thick enough to handle the 300W load without overheating.
Step 2: Soldering the Small Components
Start by soldering the components with the lowest profile to keep the board stable:
 * Resistors & Diodes: Place the resistors and the 1N4148 diodes.
 * IC Socket: Always use an IC socket for the SG3525. This prevents heat damage to the chip during soldering and allows for easy replacement.
 * Capacitors: Solder the ceramic and electrolytic capacitors. Ensure the polarity of the electrolytic capacitors is correct (the stripe indicates the negative lead).

Step 3: Installing the MOSFETs and Heatsinks
The IRF3205 MOSFETs handle all the current from the battery. At 300W, they will generate significant heat.
 * Apply a small amount of thermal grease to the back of the MOSFETs.
 * Secure them to the aluminum heatsinks tightly.
 * Solder the MOSFETs to the PCB. Note: Ensure the heatsinks do not touch each other if they are electrically "live" via the MOSFET drain, or use mica insulators.

Step 4: Connecting the Transformer
The transformer steps up the low-voltage AC generated by the MOSFETs to 220V.
 * Primary Side: Connect the Center Tap of the transformer to the Positive (+) input of the 12V battery. Connect the two side wires of the primary to the MOSFET drain outputs on the PCB.
 * Secondary Side: These two wires will provide the 220V AC output. Connect these to an AC socket or terminal block.

Step 5: Testing and Calibration
Before plugging in expensive appliances, we must test the output:
 * Connect a 12V battery to the input.
 * Using a multimeter (set to AC Voltage), measure the output terminals. It should read between 220V and 240V.
 * Frequency Check: If your multimeter has a frequency setting, check for 50Hz or 60Hz (depending on your region). Use the onboard potentiometer to adjust this if necessary.
 * Load Test: Connect a small 10W LED bulb. If it lights up steadily, the circuit is working. You can then test with higher loads like a table fan.
 * 
Step 6: Final Assembly
Once the circuit is verified, mount the PCB and transformer inside a non-conductive (plastic or wood) or grounded metal enclosure. Ensure there is adequate ventilation or a small DC fan to keep the MOSFET heatsinks cool during extended use.

⚠️ Safety Warning
 * Lethal Voltage: The output of this circuit is 220V AC, which can be fatal. Never touch the output terminals while the battery is connected.
 * Battery Safety: Use a fuse (30A-40A) between the battery and the inverter to prevent fire in case of a short circuit.
 * Polarity: Connecting the 12V battery in reverse will instantly destroy the MOSFETs and the IC. Double-check your connections.
